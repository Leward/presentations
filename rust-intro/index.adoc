= Iron Oxyde is the new thing
:source-highlighter: highlightjs

== Why learn a new language? 

* Why not
* View things from a different angle
* A different way of writing software
* It's fun
* Out of frustration

== You said frustration?

.My way of working

== Frustration

[%step]
- Bloated software
- My experience with RAD frameworks built on top of other frameowkrs 
    (I still <3 you Groovy & Grails)
- `null` everywhere
- Loose track of how things work (abstractions are nice, but... )

== There has to be a bEtter way

Back to the basics!

== My quest of new language

[%step]
- Low memory footprint
- Performances
- Compiled
- I don't like pointers

== And the contenders are

- Rust
- Go

== Iron What?

== Rust

== Why Rust?

- Both Rust and Go Look great
- Rust had more new interesting concepts
- I'm here to learn new stuff after all

== The Rust Promises

[%step]
- As fast as C, if not faster
- Memory Safety
- Has an interesting type system
- A good developer experience
- "Fearless concurrency"

== As fast as C? 

Let's check out the link:https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/faster/rust.html[The Computer Language Benchmarks Game]

Benchmarks have to be taken for what they are: benchmarks. 

But they prove that Rust's promise is not empty.

== How about the Memory Safety

[%step]
- No Garbage Collector, fine.
- No Pointer, fine.
- Really none of that? What's the trick?
- Ownership and Borrowing mechanisms

== Type System

Basic types, checked.

- integers: `i8`, `u8`, ..., `i64`, `u64`, `isize`, `usize`
- floating points: `f32`, `f64`
- boolean: `true`, `false`
- strings: `char`

== Type System

Compound types, checked.

- Tuples: `let x: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);`
- Arrays: `let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];`

== Type System: null values

`null` does not exist in Rust

`Option<T>`

== Type Systems: enums (1)

[source, rust]
----
enum Action {
    Click, 
    MouseMove,
    Scroll
}
----

== Type Systems: enums (2)

[source, rust]
----
enum Action {
    Click(x: u32, y: u32), 
    MouseMove(x: u32, y: u32),
    Scroll(length: u32)
}
----

== Pattern matching!

[source, rust]
----
fn magic_number(action: Action) -> u32
match action {
    Action::Click(x, y) => x + y,
    Action::MouseMove(x, y) => x + y,
    Action::Scroll(length) => length * 2
}
----

== `Option<T>`

[source, rust]
----
enum Option<T> {
    Some(T),
    None,
}

fn say_something(something: Option<String>) {
    match something: 
        Ok(s) => println!("{}", s),
        None => println!("I have nothing to say"),
}
----

== Let's talk about Ownership

- The compiles allocates and frees memory on our behalf
- It **must** know when
- Hence, ownership rules

== Ownership rules

- A value is own by a single variable
- You can borrow a value as mush you want for read
- You can borrow for mutation only once at a time
- Ownership guarantees **no data race is possible**

== Ownership examples

That's the tricky part

(live code \o/)

== Ownership - Move

[source, rust]
----
let a = String::from("hello");
let b = a;
println!("{}", a); // Compile error
println!("{}", b); // hello
----


[source, rust]
----
let a = 5;
let b = a;
println!("{}", a); // 5
println!("{}", b); // 5
----

== Ownership - Transfer ownership

[source, rust]
----
let s = String::from("hello");
some_function(s); 
println!("{}", s); // Compile error :( 
----

== Ownership - Borrow

[source, rust]
----
let s = String::from("hello");
some_function(&s); 
println!("{}", s); // hello
----

== Ownership - Mutable Borrow

[source, rust]
----
let s = String::from("hello");
append_world(&mut s); 
println!("{}", s); // hello world
----

== Ownership - Mutable Borrow

[source, rust]
----
let mut s = String::from("hello");
let r1 = &mut s;
let r2 = &mut s; // simultaneous mutable borrows not allowed
r1.push_str(" oh oh oh");
----

== What I liked about learning rust

- `cargo` is awesome
- Makes you really think a lot about the code write
- Learn again lew level things
- Very active and welcoming community
- Very well suited for system and game programming
- Still great for higher level things
- Bindings of libraries **for Rust**
- The link:https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/[Rust Book] is great

== An extra demo

A web application written in Rust using 
link:https://rocket.rs/[Rocket] and 
link:http://diesel.rs/[Diesel]

With link:[Maud] as a templating engine

== One more thing

First class support for testing

[source, rust]
----
fn main() {
    println!("{}", add(2, 5));
}

fn add(a: isize, b: isize) -> isize {
    a + b
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_add() {
        assert!(add(2, 5) ==  7);
    }
}
